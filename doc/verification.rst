Verification
============

Software verification aims at making software safer. In its typical use case,
it is a tool that takes as input the source code of a program with
specifications as annotations and attempt to prove --- or disprove --- their
validity.

One of the core module of Leon is a verifier for the subset of Scala described
in the sections :ref:`Pure Scala <purescala>` and :ref:`XLang <xlang>`. In this
section we describe the specification language that can be used to declare
properties of programs, as well as the safety properties automatically checked
by Leon. We also discuss how Leon can be used to prove mathematical theorems.
